                <p class="disclaimer-p">
                    Thank you for choosing our booking website for your travel needs. 
                    Before proceeding with your flight or hotel purchase, please take
                    a moment to read and understand the following disclaimer:
                    Accuracy of Information: We strive to provide accurate and up-to-date 
                    information regarding flights and hotels. However, we cannot guarantee 
                    the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of all the information presented 
                    on our website. It is recommended that you independently verify any details, 
                    such as flight schedules, hotel amenities, and availability, before making 
                    your final booking.
                    Pricing and Availability: The prices and availability of flights and hotels
                    displayed on our website are subject to change without prior notice. While 
                    we make every effort to ensure that the prices shown are accurate, there may 
                    be instances where the actual prices differ due to various factors, including 
                    but not limited to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, additional taxes, 
                    fees, or charges imposed by airlines or hotels. The availability of specific 
                    flights or hotel rooms is also subject to change and may vary at the time of 
                    booking.
                    Third-Party Suppliers: We act as an intermediary between you and third-party 
                    suppliers, such as airlines and hotels. We are not responsible for the actions, 
                    errors, omissions, warranties, or representations of these suppliers. Any issues, 
                    disputes, or claims arising from your interaction with a third-party supplier 
                    should be addressed directly with them. We encourage you to review the terms 
                    and conditions, privacy policies, and cancellation policies of these suppliers 
                    before making a booking.
                    
                    Travel Documents and Requirements: It is your responsibility to ensure that 
                    you possess the necessary travel documents, such as valid passports, visas, 
                    or any other identification required for your destination. We recommend checking 
                    the entry requirements, travel advisories, and health regulations of your 
                    destination before making any travel arrangements.
                    Limitation of Liability: We strive to provide a seamless booking experience, 
                    but we cannot be held responsible for any loss, damage, injury, delay, or 
                    inconvenience caused by events beyond our control, including but not limited 
                    to flight or hotel cancellations, overbookings, strikes, natural disasters, 
                    or acts of terrorism. Our liability is limited to the amount you paid for 
                    your booking.
                    
                    Personal Responsibility: By proceeding with your flight or hotel purchase, 
                    you acknowledge and accept personal responsibility for your decisions and 
                    actions. You agree to hold us harmless from any claims, demands, liabilities, 
                    losses, damages, or expenses arising from your use of our website or the 
                    services provided by third-party suppliers.
                    Please ensure that you carefully read and understand this disclaimer before 
                    proceeding with your booking. If you have any questions or concerns, feel
